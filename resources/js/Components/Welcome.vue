                Expense record management is a comprehensive system designed to streamline and simplify the process of recording, tracking, and managing expenses within an organization.
                It allows users to create and submit expense records, categorize expenses, attach supporting documents, and assign them to appropriate cost centers or projects.
                The system provides managers with the ability to review and approve expenses, generate reports for financial analysis and budgeting, and ensure compliance with company policies.
                By centralizing and automating expense management, organizations can achieve greater efficiency, accuracy, and control over their financial processes, leading to improved cost management and decision-making.
